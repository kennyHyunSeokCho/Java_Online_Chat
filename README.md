This is a multi-threaded and socket server-based multi-chat program developed in Java, utilizing SQL databases.
It is designed to facilitate real-time communication among users through a robust and scalable architecture.

I intended to create not only an online chat feature but also an online drawing board functionality for my project.
However, I was unable to successfully implement the online drawing board feature.
